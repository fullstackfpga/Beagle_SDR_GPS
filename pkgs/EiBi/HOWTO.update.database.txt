Procedure for updating to a new EiBi database release from eibispace.de

CAUTION:
After much confusion figured out how downloading from eibispace.de will break the file UTF-8 encoding.
Underlying cause is not understood. In browser DO NOT use right-click "download linked file" function.
Instead, use the wget/iconv combination shown. Multiple browsers have this same issue.

Download .csv and README.TXT files. Change e.g. "A24" to whatever is current on eibispace.de webpage.
"eibi.in" is just the name of a temporary file.
wget -O eibi.in http://eibispace.de/dx/sked-a24.csv && iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 eibi.in > eibi.csv
>>> Check this entry to make sure correct accented chars: 690;0000-2400;;B;R치dio Clube do Par치;P;B;be;1;;
wget -O eibi.in http://eibispace.de/dx/README.TXT && iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 eibi.in > README.A24.txt

cp eibi.csv sked-[ab]2?.ddmmmyy.csv         // file before ALE added back for diff purposes
e.g. sked-b22.14nov22.csv

cp eibi.csv sked-[ab]2?.ddmmmyy.kiwi.csv    // date included in case of updated downloaded within same [ab]2? period
e.g. sked-b22.14nov22.kiwi.csv

Added ALE back manually from A21 using BBedit:
Append file ALE-a21.kiwi.csv to sked-[ab]2?.ddmmmyy.kiwi.csv

Then to sort combined lists by freq:
	Text > Apply text transform > Sort lines
		> Configure (numbers match by value; sort using pattern; type:"[0-9.]+;" entire match; OK)
		> THEN SELECT THE SINGLE FILE WITH: Apply to: > Choose > open text documents > ...
		    SELECTION IS TRICKYHERE W/ LATEST BBEDIT. DOUBLE CHECK FILENAME!!!
            *** otherwise it will apply to the file last time sort was done!
            *** make sure multiple files are not selected!
      > Apply
		> Put back top header line (the one beginning with "kHz:")
			It gets incorrectly sorted a few dozen lines down the list
			If this _isn't_ true then sort may have not worked!

rm sked-current.csv
ln -s sked-[ab]2?.ddmmmyy.kiwi.csv sked-current.csv
make run (mr)
Will update Beagle_SDR_GPS/dx/EiBi.h file
Check that "R치dio Clube do Par치" appears correctly in EiBi.h

openwebrx.js:dx.db_s: "EiBi-[AB]yy" string will be automatically updated now.
